AI Prompt Log â€“ Stock Analytics App
Built by Marley Diallo | June 2025

This project was built using AI copilots such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini 1.5 to simulate fast AI-native development. Below are the key prompts I used to accelerate development.

---

1. "Create a dark-mode stock analytics web app using Next.js and FastAPI that fetches financial data from the FMP API."

2. "Generate a homepage with a search bar that routes users to /company/[ticker] when they enter a stock symbol."

3. "Use Chart.js in a Next.js page to display the last 30 days of closing stock prices based on FMP API data."

4. "How do I fetch and display a company profile from Financial Modeling Prep using FastAPI?"

5. "Add error handling for invalid stock tickers and display a custom error message if no data is returned."

6. "Make the entire UI responsive and investor-focused with a clean dark aesthetic inspired by Robinhood."

7. "Format large financial numbers like 87423000000 as readable strings like $87.4B in JavaScript."

8. "Write a simple FastAPI backend route that fetches financials from FMP and sends it to a frontend Next.js component."

9. "Add a styled table that shows income statements (revenue, gross profit, net income) for the last 5 years."

10. "Help me write a professional README that includes tech stack, features, setup, and links to Loom and GitHub."

11. "Create a list of AI prompts used in this project for submission documentation."

AI Usage Summary:
- Copilots accelerated development time by generating scaffolds, error handling, styling, and data visualizations.
- AI was used to debug, design wireframes, and maintain clean full-stack structure.
- The app was completed in under 4 hours as a proof-of-concept for fast, AI-native engineering.
